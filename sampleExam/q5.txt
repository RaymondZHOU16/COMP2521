    sorting algorithm the program uses.

    use different sizes of data to find time complexity and use spacify case like decraseing order
    for selecttinon, ...

(b) Is the sorting algorithm that the program uses stable? How confident
    are you in your conclusion? Explain your answer.

    stable, not certain
